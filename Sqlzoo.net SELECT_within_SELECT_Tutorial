This tutorial looks at how we can use SELECT statements within SELECT statements to perform more complex queries.

Question:

Some countries have populations more than three times that of all of their neighbors (in the same continent). Provide the names of these countries along with their continents.

Answer:

sql
Copy code
SELECT w1.name, w1.continent
FROM world w1
WHERE w1.population > 3 * (
    SELECT MAX(w2.population)
    FROM world w2
    WHERE w2.continent = w1.continent AND w2.name <> w1.name
);
This SQL query identifies countries (name) and their continents (continent) where the population (w1.population) is more than three times the maximum population of any other country (w2.population) in the same continent (w1.continent). The subquery ensures that we compare each country's population against the maximum population of its neighbors within the same continent.
